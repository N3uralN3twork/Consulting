A. Stratified Sampling Algorithm 1:
	^ Indices start @ 0
	1. Proportional Sampling:
		* The number of participants from each subgroup is determined by their number relative to the entire population
		* Let n_{i} = (N_{i}/N)*n
		* sum(n_{i}) == size == desired sample size
		* Let C = number of classes in the stratum
	2. Taking Samples for each level of the stratum:
		* Take a sample  of each level n_{i} times each
		* Combine the (size*C) samples into one dataframe
		* Sort the dataframe by the stratum
		* Reset the index to identify where each observation came from
	3. Sampling from the dataframe:
		* To select certain rows of the dataframe, you need a starting index and an ending index together
			- Ex: starting:ending
		* The number of indices needed = 2*C
			- need C indices for both the start and the end locations
		* Starting Indices:
			- First index starts at 0 and every other one (the next C-1 starting index) starts at C*size
		* Ending Indices:
			- Let the first ending index =  n_{0} + (0*size)
			- Let the second ending index = n_{1} + (1* size)
			- Let the third ending index =  n_{2} + (2*size)
			- Let the i^{th} ending index = n_{i} + ((i-1)*size)

B. Stratified Sampling Algorithm 2:
	^ Indices start @ 0
	1. Proportional Sampling:
		* Create a table of proportions for each stratum
		* Round (Size*prop) for each proportion calculated above
	2. Create a list of unique levels for each class
	3. Combine both the sizes and unique levels into a singular dataframe
	4. Create the SQL queries (excluding the groupby statement):
		* For each stratum in each group size:
			- n = sample size for each level
			- qry = empty_qry + stratum + == + level
	5. Use the qry and sample functions to find the final stratified sample
