# Repeating letters given the number of sites and the number of subjects per site:
	1. Create "AAA", "BBB", "CCC", ... first
		a. repeat the letters of the alphabet 3 times
		b. concatenate result into 1 string
	2. Repeat each one of those n times equal to the number of subjects


FIGURE OUT WHY THE SCHEMA WON'T WORK WITH 1 SITE:
	1. If Sites is numeric and the number of sites == 1:
		change "matt[column]" to just "matt" 
		&
		change "column" in the if_else statement to just "matt"
		
Make some tests to ensure that the base program works correctly
	Think this is called unit-testing
	
Let the user decide whether they would like to input sites as a number or a list of site codes:
	Via the MultiInput and ConditionalPanel functions from the "shinyWidgets" package
	If you want to input a number of sites, select "Numbers"
	If you want to input a list of site codes, select "Letters"

Create a package so that others in the class can use your library:
	Using a .Rd file extension:
	Create documentation for your package using Roxygen2

		@author
		@section
		@import
		@export

Don't forget to document your code and application
